# MIA-EPT – Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data

## Overview
This research presents a novel approach for predicting membership inference attacks (MIA) against models trained on synthetic tabular data. Our method utilizes shadow models, helper machine-learning models, and an attack classifier. Helper models are trained on synthetic datasets generated by the models. Each helper model performs regression or classification tasks, predicting individual column values based on the remaining attributes. For shadow models, prediction errors from helper models on datasets with known membership statuses are used as input features to train the attack classifier. Subsequently, for the target model, prediction errors from helper models on datasets with unknown membership statuses are computed and used as input features by the attack classifier to predict membership status. The key intuition behind our approach is that helper models exhibit lower prediction errors for samples included in the synthetic model's training set, thereby enabling membership detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in revealing privacy risks inherent in diffusion-based synthetic data generation.

## Setup Instructions  

### Prerequisites  
Before running the code, ensure you have Python (>=3.8) installed.

To install the required dependencies, run:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

### Running Steps
To run the full pipeline, execute the following command:  

```bash
python main.py
```

This will generate the feature vectors for the shadow models and the attack classifier, train the attack classifier, and evaluate the performance of the attack classifier.
To evaluate the results of the attack classifier, we run the evaluation on 25 models as train and the other 5 as test. The evaluation is done by computing the AUC-ROC score and the TPR@FPR for different fpr values.
After running the evaluation, in order to create a final file to submmited to the competition, we run the training of the attack classifier with all the models.

Then to generate the final file you will need to run the following command:

```bash
python create_prediction_folder.py --output_folder <output_folder>
```
