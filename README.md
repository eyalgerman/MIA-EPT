# MIA-EPT – Membership Inference Attack via Error Prediction for Tabular Data

## Overview
This research presents a novel approach for predicting membership inference attacks (MIA) against models trained on synthetic tabular data. Our method utilizes shadow models, helper machine-learning models, and an attack classifier. Helper models are trained on synthetic datasets generated by the models. Each helper model performs regression or classification tasks, predicting individual column values based on the remaining attributes. For shadow models, prediction errors from helper models on datasets with known membership statuses are used as input features to train the attack classifier. Subsequently, for the target model, prediction errors from helper models on datasets with unknown membership statuses are computed and used as input features by the attack classifier to predict membership status. The key intuition behind our approach is that helper models exhibit lower prediction errors for samples included in the synthetic model's training set, thereby enabling membership detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in revealing privacy risks inherent in diffusion-based synthetic data generation.
